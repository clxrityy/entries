# Epigraph — <i>“It isn’t all on you, Mom”</i>
### 07.03.2022

Today, well, a long time ago, really, I had discovered that my mom made a blog of her own. I don’t think she ever intended to hide it from me (considering the link to it is in her instagram)... However, it always felt like something I wasn’t supposed to read. I can’t even remember how long ago it was that I had first noticed it. I even dared to click on it one day, only to decide for myself that maybe, with whatever dark thoughts are in my head, I couldn’t bare to take on hers. I closed it out immediately. She’s the person I’ve always sought out for comfort, for help, whenever I felt like there was no help or comfort I could give myself. I thought that ever seeing her be weak would be detrimental to me. Today I read her entire blog. I sat there with my pot of leftover cold pasta that my sister had made hours ago. I didn’t eat a bite of it while reading despite not eating a bite of anything the entire day and working all day. I was entirely captivated by her perspective and writing style. I was captivated by how human she is. There’s never been a time that I thought my mother was anything supernatural, but perhaps I’ll forget that, with as much as I struggle, and even as much as I notice her struggle, there are thoughts and feelings behind it. Maybe I forget that about everyone. Mothers are always given a lot of credit for all they do for their children and the endless level of love they carry for them. Perhaps it’s always a case of “Thank you, Mom”, when in a lot of cases a mother may need a “It isn’t all on you, Mom”. Today, Mom, I read a glimpse of how you feel. I don’t feel the way I feared I would. I don’t know what I was afraid of.

I read lines of my mother visibly struggling with my two younger siblings, but not a single line where she seems to struggle with me. I know that if this were a different time, perhaps these lines would all be about me. I don’t feel relief that these lines aren’t about me, but more-so a need to reassure both my mom and my sisters that - just like how - there was a time where lines were for me - there will be a time where no lines are for them. There will always be lines of things to write about, and that is the beauty, isn’t it? There will be another story. With every story there’s an ending, and the beginning of another starts. If everything fails, the story continues. Keep reading. You’ll never know what happens next if you don’t.
