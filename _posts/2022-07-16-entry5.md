# It is what It is â€” <i>"As I learn and grow, I've found that the ideas and the clothes I wore before start to fit tighter and tighter."</i>

### 07.16.2022

It's been a second since I've written an entry. I don't know why I haven't written. I haven't been occupied or busy. In fact I've wanted to write one. It calms me and allows me to reflect. To be honest, I *think* I've written two and deleted them. **Allegedly**. I'm not confirming or denying this. If I had though, why would I have done that? Was I sharing too much? Am I so overly critical of myself that not even I, myself, am good enough for myself?

<hr>

Yes, I think that's it.

We must all be this way as I more commonly find people able to name things they'd change, rather than what they are appreciative for, about themselves. Why are we like this, or at least seemingly a good chunk of us? Why am I? Why can't I be satisfied? There's no winning this game against myself. It's such...
```{toggle}
bullshit
```

<hr>

I let myself get ahead of myself there. It's not so bad. 

Okay, it does kind of suck.

Like, it really does.

But, if you haven't read any of these yet, I kind of like to find the bright side of things. Even if there is what appears to be *no bright side*, maybe I try to shine a flashlight of my own.

I'll be truthful. I've been trying to imagine a scenario in which being self critical is beneficial. Obviously, it can be in ways. It's not like I can't think of ways it has helped me. However, I just kept thinking about how it would all be so much easier and less stressful if I just could be happy with who I am.

I spend a lot of time convincing myself that everything has a meaning and nothing is just *the way it is* for no reason. I've even argued in favor of this ideology (the "everything happens for a reason" view). I won't say that thinking this way hasn't done me any good, it has. It's done a lot for me. It gives me hope when I feel like there is none. In fact, I can't even help but believe it still.

That being said, I think I've decided I'm slightly growing out of it. I don't know, actually, if "growing out of it" is the correct word usage. How about, I'm growing, but it's not? I don't know. I'm gonna have to stop this line of thinking where I'm trying to explain what I'm thinking without actually explaining. 

<hr>

As I learn and grow, I've found that the ideas and the clothes I wore before start to fit tighter and tighter. It's almost as if I'm supposed to let them go before I even know I'm letting them go. Otherwise, they get stuck to me and become harder to let go of. How is this fair? We consume things around us so that we can evolve, but the things we consume get left for something or someone else. Our parents create us from thin air (and biology), raise us, teach us what we know, and then we're forced to let them go and grow more without them. It's a sad thing, I guess. It's sad for everyone. It's sad for someone to have to let go, and it's sad for that someone or something that is being let go of. 

That's truly human nature, I think (amongst other things). *The circle of life* if you will.

##### *Wait.*

> I've just realized that I said before I was going to *"shine a flashlight"*. Have I? I don't think so. I don't know if I need to. I'm quite tired, so I don't really need a light on. Besides, I don't have any batteries for it right now anyway.

If I look at life a certain way everything feels rather pointless and hopeless. A thought will pass like, **"if I'm going to get in my bed tonight, why should I bother making it this morning?"**. Or, if it were darker, **if I'm just going to die, why should I live?**.

Maybe I'm oblivious and stupidly optimistic to think that's the exact reason I should live and make my bed. If nothing means anything, and I'm going to die someday, I'm still here right now. I'm still me. I still feel and I still see. So, why would I not make this useless journey enjoyable for myself and the ones I love?

## If everything means nothing, it doesn't change anything.

> ## *What if you were given two options right now?*  

1. Go wherever you want to go, for however long you want to stay, and get to do whatever you want to do.
2. Live the same life you've always lived and nothing will change.

The choice seems easy. It's so easy that if I told you both choices are the same... Oh, I forgot to mention, with option number one, you will return and forget the entire thing ever happened.

Does your choice change?

Mine doesn't.

<hr>

This life is what you make it. So, make it what you want.
