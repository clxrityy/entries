# Dear Older Me â€” <i>"I hope someday I have the strength to be weak."</i>

### 07.07.2022

I decided to open up this blog-type-site a bit more. I added a place for people to submit entries. I'm not sure quite yet how I'll even integrate them, as I originally made this just for my own thoughts. Perhaps I'll add an entirely separate page, like "other authors"... Something like that... I don't know. I doubt anyone will submit anything, anyway. If you're interested, though, [submit here](../submit.html).
<hr>
I thought I'd dedicate this entry, however, to my older self. I remember when I was in 5th grade we made these time capsule-like-envelopes. Inside of them, we included things like our current interests, current favorite color, etc... The objective was to open it when you turned 18 to see how much you've changed. Instead of saying the type of person I am now and comparing it to later, I'm gonna say the type of person I hope to be. I feel like this might be a bad thing to do, honestly. Stay with me, though. I'll find a way to make it a good thing.

#### I hope the older me stays young inside.

I hope as old as I get I never forget the desire to have fun and laugh. If I get tired of something, I hope I get awakened by something else. I never want to forget the pleasure of little things. I never want to feel like it's too late for me to do anything. I hope when I look in the mirror I merely see a reflection of my physical appearance and never feel limited. While, I fear there will be a day I don't desire to heel click when I'm in an open space, I can dream that I never lose that side of myself.

#### I hope I never settle for what's easiest.

If there's a path a want to take, but another path with less obstacles, I hope I take the path I want. I hope I fight to have what I feel like I deserve. I hope I don't ever stop challenging myself and allowing myself opportunities to grow. I never want to be stuck in a relationship because I feel like it's all I know. I never want to be stuck anywhere. I hope I can always find and see the beauty/comfort in the familiar, but always travel outside of it.

#### I hope I know what's best for me.

When options are presented to me, I hope I can see which one is for me. If people give me a hard time, I want the capability to deal with it in the way that will benefit me the most. I hope I know when to push myself and when to let myself rest. I hope that when I push myself that I do it right.
