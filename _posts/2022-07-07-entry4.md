# Dear Older Me â€” <i>"I hope I know who I am."</i>

### 07.07.2022

I decided to open up this blog-type-site a bit more. I added a place for people to submit entries. I'm not sure quite yet how I'll even integrate them, as I originally made this just for my own thoughts. Perhaps I'll add an entirely separate page, like "other authors"... Something like that... I don't know. I doubt anyone will submit anything, anyway. If you're interested, though, [submit here](../submit.html).

I thought I'd dedicate this entry, however, to my older self. I remember when I was in 5th grade we made these time capsule-like-envelopes. Inside of them, we included things like our current interests, current favorite color, etc... The objective was to open it when you turned 18 to see how much you've changed. Instead of saying the type of person I am now and comparing it to later, I'm gonna say the type of person I hope to be. I feel like this might be a bad thing to do, honestly. Stay with me, though. I'll find a way to make it a good thing.

### I hope the older me stays young inside.

I hope as old as I get I never forget the desire to have fun and laugh. If I get tired of something, I hope I get awakened by something else. I never want to forget the pleasure of little things. I never want to feel like it's too late for me to do anything. I hope when I look in the mirror I merely see a reflection of my physical appearance and never feel limited. While, I fear there will be a day I don't desire to heel click when I'm in an open space, I can dream that I never lose that side of myself.

### I hope I never settle for what's easiest.

If there's a path a want to take, but another path with less obstacles, I hope I take the path I want. I hope I fight to have what I feel like I deserve. I hope I don't ever stop challenging myself and allowing myself opportunities to grow. I never want to be stuck in a relationship because I feel like it's all I know. I never want to be stuck anywhere. I hope I can always find and see the beauty/comfort in the familiar, but always travel outside of it.

### I hope I know what's best for me.

When options are presented to me, I hope I can see which one is for me. If people give me a hard time, I want the capability to deal with it in the way that will benefit me the most. I hope I know when to push myself and when to let myself rest. I hope that when I push myself that I do it right.

### I hope I spread love.

Even when I feel something's got the best of me, I hope I just give love in return. I don't believe love runs out, and I hope I continue to believe that and harness that energy into spreading love wherever I go. If there's something or someone I appreciate, I want that something or someone to feel and know my appreciation. I hope I don't ever hold back from giving love as it is inherently what everyone desires.

### I hope nothing is ever about money.

Money is just that, money. It's an illusion and in it's physical form just paper. I hope, if given the appropriate chances, I won't make my decisions based on money. I've said the past years that I don't desire to ever be rich. I never want to feel like everything is within my reach. I want to be happy.

### I hope I keep what I need to keep and share what I need to share.

I've, for a long time, believed that sharing is caring. Maybe I believed we have a duty to share how our mind works, share our knowledge, share our feelings, and spread ourselves like viruses to each other. I've only recently developed the idea that *my mind* is just that, *my mind*. It is the only place where people (who aren't mind readers) can't access. With the growing increase of technology in our day-to-day lives, almost nothing about ourselves is private. I can only anticipate, with what I've seen in my current lifetime, that it will continue to grow. I hope I can keep that in mind.

I hope if I see something beautiful, however, that I share somehow the beauty I've witnessed. I hope that if I have children, I share with them the things about my life that could help them in theirs, but keep to myself the things that never helped me.

I hope I never find myself bottling my feelings inside, but find the appropriate way to share what needs to be shared about them.

### I hope technology never gets the best of me.

As someone who's primary focus, major in school, and overall related interests pertains to technology... I hope it doesn't consume me. I hope I can find the beauty in natural things, and remember my life is in front of me. When I'm looking into a computer screen, I'm not seeing the life in front of me, I'm seeing the depths of inner workings of whatever I choose to click on. While it's fascinating, endlessly engaging, and at times becomes my comfort zone, like I said before, I hope I venture out of my comfort zone. I never want to be stuck in technology.

### I hope I know who I am.

Lastly, I want to be sure of myself. I want to be confident in the person I know I am. I want to be able to do what I know I can do. I struggle with this the most today, and I hope, with time, I'm more sure of what makes me <i>me</i>.
