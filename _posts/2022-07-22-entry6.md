# Depression & Commitment Issues — <i>"The highs feel so high, but the lows can feel... Low."</i>

### 07.22.2022

I have this issue with my brain. I've convinced myself that it's rather unique and something not a lot of other people seem to battle with. However, maybe it's just **commitment issues**.

<hr>

If you're someone who doesn't struggle with inner turmoil around due dates, commitments, and overall doing anything you've said you were going to do, then maybe you don't need to read the rest of this. 

<hr>

The thing is if I'm in a *good place* (mentally) commitments aren't *as* difficult. I'll decide ahead of time that, whatever it is I need to do, I don't have a choice. It's a commitment I've made to someone or something, but more importantly it's an agreement I've made with myself that I have to do.

However, if I'm in a *bad place*, just like how *everything* becomes more difficult, commitments are nearly impossible. 

I've chalked it up to:

<ul>
    <li>Depression makes you unable to make decisions.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>I can't decide for myself that it's something I need to do.</li>
        </ul>
    <li>Depression makes you have no motivation.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>I, quite literally, have no motivation to fullfill the desired task.</li>
        </ul>
    <li>Depression makes you lack a sense of dedication toward your goals.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Complete *this* so you can do *this*? Nope, don't care.</li>
        </ul>
    <li>Depression makes your mind weak.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>In times where I feel **strong**, I find it relatively easy to gain control of what I need and what I need to do. The latter, however, it feels impossible.</li>
        </ul>
</ul>

So, I mentioned depression in each of these. I guess I'm blaming it on depression, then? I didn't know that's what I was going to blame it on. 

<hr>

Depression is a bitch, though. I think I should feel honored that I struggle with depression. I mean, look what this says:

For decades, scientists have known that eminently creative individuals have a much higher rate of manic depression, or bipolar disorder, than does the general population.

The way I've always interpreted this information is that: *those with a powerful mind have the capacity to experience things more powerfully*.

If you resonate, you probably feel as if you have an above average intelligence in some sense. Perhaps you overhear conversations and see through things people say... Or, you've always felt like you can understand certain things better? Maybe it's just a feeling, or a superiority complex, or an illusion to feel better about yourself. Maybe, though, you have more of a sense of something than you feel people often do.

It's a gift and a curse. The highs feel so high, but the lows can feel... Low. 

<hr>

The kicker is, though (at least for me), when I'm in a *high* phase where everything is smooth sailing, fun, and happy; I'm constantly aware of what's ahead. It's as if I'm riding a roller coaster and I can see that I am up high, but I can also see that a fall is coming. However, it also means when I'm *low*, I never truly feel that all hope is lost as I know the roller coaster has more highs ahead. 

Sometimes one ruins another. My highs are with a constant awareness that a low is ahead, but my lows are comforted by the highs ahead.

I think depression comes or works alongside with fear as well. While fear comes from just about anything. We fear what we don't know and we fear what we do. Sometimes I'm afraid when I don't even know I am. Fear will consume you. The fear of being hurt has inherently caused me to shut down things that'll make me feel good.

One thing is for certain, and you've heard this more than once:

### Face your fears.

I'm terrified of roller coasters. However, I need to channel the energy to listen to the *"it's fun and it's over before you know it"* side of my brain, rather than the *"don't do it, it's the end of the world"* side.

I think I need to do that with roller coasters, and the roller coaster of life as well.

Even if I'm scared, I should ride anyway. Even though I'm scared of falling, I should never pass up the opportunity to fly.

*Thanks for taking a look inside my brain for a moment.*
