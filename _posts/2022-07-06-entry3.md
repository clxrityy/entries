This entry isn't for the people who aren't keen to believing in things they can't see. The thing is, I do. I believe in everything. I believe everything is connected and builds and connects everything. If you asked me to explain it, I could, perhaps in a way only I would understand.

Who am I? What am I? What am I meant to do, if anything? Do I have a purpose? 

Maybe I don't have a purpose, maybe I do, and I'm yet to figure it out. Either option scares me, honestly. If I don't have a purpose, am I lost forever searching for a way to find <i>something</i>? If I have a purpose, what if I don't find it? What if I never know what it is? What if I don't fullfill it?

I believe this is all arbitrary. If I have a purpose, why would I care? If I don't, why would I care? Either way, everything is what I make of it. I've spent a lot of my life with a mindset that I can't even remember now. Perhaps my mind blocked it out because it was traumatizing. Perhaps I no longer have a need to see the dark side of things. That's not to say that I won't feel hopeless in moments. That's not to say I'll never lose my way.
