# Being Strong and Being Weak â€” <i>"I hope someday I have the strength to be weak."</i>

### 07.06.2022

I believe in everything. I believe everything is connected and builds and connects everything. If you asked me to explain it, I could, perhaps in a way only I would understand.

> *Who am I? What am I? What am I meant to do, if anything? **Do I have a purpose?***

Maybe I don't have a purpose, maybe I do, and I'm yet to figure it out. Either option scares me, honestly. If I don't have a purpose, am I lost forever searching for a way to find <i>something</i>? If I have a purpose, what if I don't find it? What if I never know what it is? What if I don't fullfill it?

I believe this is all arbitrary. If I have a purpose, why would I care? If I don't, why would I care? Either way, everything is what I make of it. I've spent a lot of my life with a mindset that I can't even remember now. Perhaps my mind blocked it out because it was traumatizing. Perhaps I no longer have a need to see the dark side of things. That's not to say that I won't feel hopeless in moments. That's not to say I'll never lose my way.

I think I've become really secure with myself. I don't feel like anything can penetrate the walls I've built up to protect myself. It might be a bad thing. A lot of times, I worry that it is. I worry that I'll never let anyone in. I worry I'll never feel love, truly, because I've spent so much time trying to protect myself and build up all these walls. I think I am capable of it, or at least, I'd like to think so. Maybe I'm too afraid of vulnerability. Almost everything I do nowadays is to reinforce my strength. Perhaps I need to reinforce the idea in my head that even if I let my guard down and someone stabs me where I'm weak, I'll still heal. With being so fixated on being strong, I should realize that every time I'm broken down, I'm always built up stronger. I hope someday I have the strength to be weak.

As I'm writing this, I am **21** years old. I've never quite been in love. I've had quite a few instances of *love interests*. The one that always sticks with me the most was my best friend when I was fifteen to seventeen years old. I loved her. I put the both of us through hell because I hadn't come to terms with my sexuality. In the end, she met someone. It broke my heart. It really did. I've still to this day never felt a heartbreak like that. I don't know what my walls were like then, but I let her in. I trusted her with everything in my heart. I depended on her like nothing else because she was my only friend, and I think that's what made the heart break hurt the most. It hurt to lose that love, but maybe it hurt more to just lose her.

I wonder at times if I'm traumatized from it. I think I become traumatized quite easily. Things happen that affect me so deeply it changes how my brain perceives and treats everything else.
