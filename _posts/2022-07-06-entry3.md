# Strength & Balance â€” <i>"I hope someday I have the strength to be weak."</i>

### 07.06.2022

I believe in everything. I believe everything is connected and builds and connects everything. If you asked me to explain it, I could, perhaps in a way only I would understand.

> *Who am I? What am I? What am I meant to do, if anything? **Do I have a purpose?***

Maybe I don't have a purpose, maybe I do, and I'm yet to figure it out. Either option scares me, honestly. If I don't have a purpose, am I lost forever searching for a way to find <i>something</i>? If I have a purpose, what if I don't find it? What if I never know what it is? What if I don't fullfill it?

I believe this is all arbitrary. If I have a purpose, why would I care? If I don't, why would I care? Either way, everything is what I make of it. I've spent a lot of my life with a mindset that I can't even remember now. Perhaps my mind blocked it out because it was traumatizing. Perhaps I no longer have a need to see the dark side of things. That's not to say that I won't feel hopeless in moments. That's not to say I'll never lose my way.

I think I've become really secure with myself. I don't feel like anything can penetrate the walls I've built up to protect myself. It might be a bad thing. A lot of times, I worry that it is. I worry that I'll never let anyone in. I worry I'll never feel love, truly, because I've spent so much time trying to protect myself and build up all these walls. I think I am capable of it, or at least, I'd like to think so. Maybe I'm too afraid of vulnerability. Almost everything I do nowadays is to reinforce my strength. Perhaps I need to reinforce the idea in my head that even if I let my guard down and someone stabs me where I'm weak, I'll still heal. With being so fixated on being strong, I should realize that every time I'm broken down, I'm always built up stronger. I hope someday I have the strength to be weak.

As I'm writing this, I am **21** years old. I've never quite been in love. I've had quite a few instances of *love interests*. The one that always sticks with me the most was my best friend when I was fifteen to seventeen years old. I loved her. I put the both of us through hell because I hadn't come to terms with my sexuality. In the end, she met someone. It broke my heart. It really did. I've still to this day never felt a heartbreak like that. I don't know what my walls were like then, but I let her in. I trusted her with everything in my heart. I depended on her like nothing else because she was my only friend, and I think that's what made the heart break hurt the most. It hurt to lose that love, but maybe it hurt more to just lose her.

I wonder at times if I'm traumatized from it. I think I become traumatized quite easily. Things happen that affect me so deeply it changes how my brain perceives and treats everything else. It's ridiculous to me that because of a human experience, like heartbreak, maybe I've taught myself I can't let it happen again. 

With everything being said, with me questioning and concluding a purpose in life doesn't matter, I still have one belief about myself that I can't seem to shake the idea of. My purpose is love. When I'm not dreaming or idealizing my current passions, I'm dreaming or idealizing the idea of love. I ache to love. I ache to make someone feel safe and loved, and to feel that way for them. I've found that, with everything I long to have in life, the more I hopelessly reach for something that feels out of my reach, the further away it becomes. I don't think this applies as a set in stone law. I believe you have to work for the things you want. Yet, somehow, and sometimes, I think we do need to allow things to find us rather than searching for it.

The universe has a funny way of doing things. A way that can't really be explained or chalked up to laws of physics.
> **Take Ryan as an example.**
> > Ryan, every day, goes to the store. He's been wearing torn pants forever, and goes to the store every day to look for a new pair of pants. Every day the pants he tries on don't fit, or don't feel right. So he goes the next day, and the next day. Still, no pair of pants work out. One day he decides to not go, or to give up going to the store. It feels hopeless to him as he never finds what he's looking for. A week goes by and it's time for his family vacation to the beach. While at the beach, him and his brother go to the markets mainly just to escape their family for a moment. Him and his brother split up, and when they reunite, his brother says to him "I found these jeans on clearance, they look like something you'd wear". Ryan tries them on and they fit and feel perfect.
> *Why did this happen? Why seemingly only when he stops looking for it, he finds it (or it finds him)? Was he looking in the wrong place? Or, is it all just supposed to be some funny coincidence?*

If you asked for my explanation, everything we know and see is a balancing act. The universe is. All the universe knows to do is *balance* everything within it. Our solar system works so perfectly, with the sun gravitating at such a perfect force to hold all the planets together in their rotation. If one thing moves, it affects another thing, and so on. So, maybe, in the grand scheme of the universe, the energy Ryan put out to look for these pants only pushed them further away, like opposing magnets. When he changed this energy, and for our metaphorical purposes, turned the magnet around, the energy was then attracted to him.

I can't claim to understand anything and everything. I can't know how to manipulate the inner workings of the balance of the universe. I don't want to know how to. I want to be surprised and able to appreciate the beauty of something when it comes my way. We all find ourselves in places where it feels like the balance just isn't right. It's a beautiful thing to know pain and to know that the things we love don't last forever. The more understanding we grasp of things, the less beautifully unique it may appear. I liked being a kid watching a puppet show and not knowing how the hell those things were controlled by humans. I don't appreciate a puppet show quite as much now that I understand it.

Let yourself be oblivious. Let yourself appreciate something or someone without feeling the need to understand it.
