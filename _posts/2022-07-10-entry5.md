# Phantom Cold Water â€” <i>"You see one dark thing and suddenly you learn how to see the dark side of things."</i>

### 07.10.2022

So, I think I figured it out. There are two things I'm referring to.

<hr>

**One**, I figured out what I want to do with this whole site. I'm going to make it where anyone can sign up and post their own entries. There will be no likes, no comments, just a free space to speak. You will be able to fully customize your own page and posts/entries, remain anonymous if you wish, and/or share the link the to your profile. 

Hopefully, I'll stay with this project and get it up and running. I have a hard time committing to things, finishing things, and remaining inspired. I feel inspired for now, though. We'll see.

<hr>

**Two**, I figured out what happened in my life (partially). I've had a lot of pieces of the puzzle scattered in my head for a while, and just let them stay scattered carelessly. Today I thought about it, and I might of put some pieces together.

###### Preface

> I thought about erasing and never posting this entry. It feels very vulnerable to share the part of my life that I felt the weakest. I also understand that possibly a lot of people might not quite understand it, or possibly see me differently. Nonetheless, I guess you noticed I'm posting it anyway.

When I was 11 or 12 years old, or whenever I began middle school, I had felt like I was forced to face an impossible task. This task was simply to go to school. In most cases, with my anxiety anyway, I dip my toe in the water and feel it's too cold for me to jump in and become too scared to. It's when I jump in that I finally feel like *alright, this wasn't impossible*. This was different. I knew I had no choice but to jump in. So, I did. I got out and felt like I could never get back in because it was so cold that it was painful.

I'll stop speaking metaphorically now. I don't know what it was about middle school. I've heard from countless people I wasn't alone in that feeling, but still, I can't even pin point what made it so hard. Then again, I can't really remember much. Sometimes, I feel like I'll see something in a particular light and fear that sight even when I don't see it. I don't know if that makes sense at all, but, when I try to remember what made me so anxious, it's a particular vision. It's not just how it looks in my head or even how it feels. I'm trying to determine what it exactly it is but truthfully I don't know. It's *something*. It's a blinding mental image of being uncomfortable. It's a toxic thought that will infect any and every other thought around it.

I picture a particular part of the inside of my middle school, lighting is weird, and the imagery is slightly... Slanted? I don't know how to describe it. It's almost like it's a part of the school I've never seen, but have seen, but can't fathom why it makes or made me feel the way it did. Every time I saw this, I thought of not experiences or feelings. I suppose the best way to describe it was that after picturing it too many times, I formed an idea in my head. An idea that wasn't real until I made it real. The idea was no matter how, no matter what I have to do, I can't go back. 

<hr>

I could go on about this time in my life. I'll try to cut it short, though. I was the most anxious I've ever been for the first ~2 months of middle school. I had a grace period afterward. I still felt set off and anxious randomly, but it felt like maybe everything would be okay. At some point I fell. I became so depressed that it was like nothing mattered. The good, the bad, it was all relative. Everything felt blank. Everything felt useless and purposeless. Someone could've told me I'd won the lottery, that I'd been granted super powers, anything, and I would've been unphased. Every time I'd try and pull myself up I'd feel like I would lose ahold of everything and fall even deeper.

I think that I was so anxious before that I used up everything in me. All the power I had to function and feel things was used up. I felt like nothing. To make things worse, I ended up leaving school, as if the idea I had gotten in my head before was terminal and was always going to happen. I left all my friends, my drive, and my life behind when I left. For a bit of time, I still felt connected to all of that. I still felt like I could, say, hang out with my friends if I wanted to. With time, and no effort from me to maintain anything, I lost the connections I had. Then it was really dark.

I think what I've meant to portray with opening up about that time is mainly that with a brief period of feeling like life was impossible, I let life become impossible. That time in your life, when you're young, but beginning to really feel conscious about things other than just being young, is a rough time to lose control. You see one dark thing and suddenly you learn how to see the dark side of things, or forget how to see the light. 

<hr>

I lost a lot of my youth to depression and the illusion in my mind that I had no control. However, I've said this before, and I'll say it again, there's beauty in pain. You fall down and you pick yourself up. You fall down some more and you learn how to walk better so that you won't fall. You get broken down only to be built back up stronger.

I'm still falling, still learning, and by all means haven't figured out how to hold myself up all the time. That's okay, though. The more I fall over the more I learn how to get back up. I stand today the tallest and sturdiest I've ever stood (quite literally, I've actually grown about an inch in the last year).
